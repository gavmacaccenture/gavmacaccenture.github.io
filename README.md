        <h2>What is Cheese?</h2>
        <p>Cheese is a dairy product that comes in a wide variety of textures, flavors, and forms. It is made from the milk of mammals, such as cows, goats, and sheep. The process of cheese-making involves curdling milk, separating the solid curds from the liquid whey, and aging the curds to develop complex flavors.</p>
